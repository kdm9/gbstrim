  a murderous rampage through your FASTQ files, don't blame me.**

Use features of the Genotyping-by-Sequencing protocol to intelligently remove
second-read read-though from GBS data.

This removes adaptor contamination, as well as removing the second read of a
read-through pair, so that the number of reads per locus/allele is not
inflated.


More to come, this is just the initial blurb.
